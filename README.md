# Ray-Tracer
The ray tracer is designed to simulate realistic lighting and shadows through computational methods, without the need for any graphics-specific languages. This implementation focuses on rendering 3D scenes by tracing the interaction of light rays with spherical objects, emphasizing the development of an efficient illumination model.

Features:
Spherical Geometry: Ability to accurately ray trace spheres, capturing their nuances in a 3D space.
Pixel Ray Tracing: Executes ray tracing with a dedicated ray per pixel, ensuring detailed image resolution.
Directional Lighting: Incorporates at least one directional light source to enhance scene realism through dynamic shadows and highlights.
Advanced Illumination Model: Implements a comprehensive illumination model that supports ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components, enabling realistic lighting effects tailored to each scene's specific conditions.
